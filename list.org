* Smiley objectives
** DONE Draw a midground smiley at coord x=350, y=50 with radius=50
** DONE WASD should move it around by 10 pixels per event
** DONE OP keys should divide/multiply its radius by 1.1
** DONE QE keys should reduce/increase angle by 1/37th of a revolution.
** DONE T should toggle a "trail" (aka stop clearing)
** DONE B should toggle a background of 2 other smileys 
Note: call clear() here when toggling this.
** DONE F should toggle a foreground of 2 other smileys
*** DONE One of the foreground smileys should rotate
It should rotate in the opposite direction to the player-moveable
one. Note: call clear() when toggling this.
** DONE M should toggle support for moving the smiley via the mouse
** DONE The background should be on by default
** DONE The foreground should be on by default
** DONE The trail should be off by default.
** DONE The mouse-control should be off by default
The trail *doesn't* have to be preserved across F and B
toggles. Typically, either of these toggles will have the side-effect
of erasing the current trail.

The drawBackground and drawForeground functions have been provided for
you, but you'll have to modify the foreground one to implement the
counter-rotation feature.

* Design
** DONE Put all key events into a assoc. array
** DONE Key event simply consults e.which
Use String.fromCharCode to get the character pressed.

* Personal todos (after moving to jsfiddle)
** TODO Embed smiley "library" from GitHub as external resource.
** TODO Add tabindex="1" to the canvas declaration
** TODO Remove the onload function.
*** TODO Move event binding out of the function.
*** TODO Put the g_canvas and g_ctx assignments back.
** TODO Possibly reset the drawDefaultSmiley function?
** TODO Switch from tabs to spaces?
